## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about Mobile First Approach. I was able to practice flex box and CSS custom properties as well.

### Continued development

This was my first ever UI challenge on Frontend Mentor. It was a little rough at start. I would like to learn more about the best way to use flexbox. After looking at the designs, I can say that my solution might be having some extra height than the provided designs. Also I would like to explore more on the box shadow property.
